# 👋 Hi there, I'm Pablo (a.k.a Pabs)

My background is multicolor:

Studied criminalistics; worked for the Argentinean government for a couple of years; left the country to go travelling and started working at events and gastronomy; moved to Berlin where I managed a restaurant for 5 years... That's when I fully understood the power of data driven decision making! 

🎓 I recently graduated from a **Data Science & Machine Learning bootcamp** at Code Academy Berlin, where I built projects applying machine learning, data wrangling, and visualization techniques.

🔍 I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems — especially in **sustainability**, **public health**, and **urban mobility**.

📂 My portfolio includes work with:
- 🏙️ **Geospatial analysis** (Capital Bikeshare DC & Public Transport proximity)
- 🌱 **Sustainable construction** (Predicting pollutants in building materials)
- 📰 **Web scraping & NLP** (Crypto news sentiment analysis)
- 📊 **Dashboard development** (Streamlit apps for financial/air quality monitoring)

**Languages:** Python, SQL  
**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Folium, TextBlob, BeautifulSoup  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter, VS Code, Streamlit, AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, Railway
